Project Name: 
Handwritten digit recognition.

Project Description: 
•	The goal of this project is to create a model that will be able to recognize and determine the handwritten digits from its image by using the concepts of Artificial Neural Network. 
•	Perform a digit classification to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images from the MNIST dataset from keras. 
•	MNIST database of handwritten digits is used as dataset. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
•	The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28*28 pixels (784 pixels).
